%% To complete this course you must pass the exam and hand in a report
%% describing the work you did for this lab. Together with this report
%% you'll hand in your code and some illustrative result videos and still
%% images. Instead of mailing multi-gigabyte video documents, you should
%% put them somewhere in your web site (public_html) and  the link to me.
%%
%% Note that the most important part is to implement the tracker in a correct
%% way. After you made sure your implementation is correct, try the tracker on
%% a video in a different domain (search on the internet to find a good video
%% or create your own video). Keep in mind that when looking for a suitable
%% video, the goal is not to show how good the tracker works, but try to put
%% your finger on the strong and weak parts of the algorithm. After you analyzed
%% these strong and weak points of the algorithm, try to come up with suggestions
%% to improve your design. If there is still enough time, you can implement one
%% or more of your suggestions and analyze the results (for instance, how does
%% your improvement compare to the original algorithm with respect to the weak
%% as well as the strong parts of the original algorithm). If you run out of
%% time, you can describe how you would change the design and explain your
%% expectations of this change. 
%%
%%
%% The report should be about 10 pages long. This should be long enough
%% to give a thorough description of your work, including introduction,
%% conclusions and a discussion. In a paper-style report, the introduction
%% would consist of a problem description (object tracking) and some related
%% work (mention some approaches taken by other researchers, you can use
%% the reader for this or look some up yourself). Then, give an outline
%% of the approach that you have taken (mean-shift and color histograms).
%% Describe the used algorithm and features in you own words. In the next
%% sections, you can write about your implementation and the experimental
%% results. Make sure to mention all relevent issues that you have done
%% and why. For instance, make mention of your approach to color, which
%% color model and why. When writing this part, keep in mind that a reader
%% should be able to reproduce your results by using the information in this
%% report. After that, give a detailed report of the results of your tracker,
%% including graphs and screenshots. In the final section(s), you can give a
%% discussion of your results, in which you can comment on the tracking results
%% and introduce improvements that you have thought of. Furthermore, describe
%% what the effects of your improvement are, or, for lack of time, describe
%% what you expect the effects of the proposed improvements would be. Mention
%% things like processing speed (and possible improvements), the handling of
%% different domains (is one general solution possible, should the tracker be
%% adapted for each domain, how will the adaptation be done, etc.). Don't forget
%% to include your references at the end, and cite your sources in the text.
