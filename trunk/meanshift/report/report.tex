	\section{Introduction}
		Robust real-time tracking of objects in a sequence of video frames is one of
		the core problems of computer vision. A target object needs to be localized
		and represented in such a way as to be insensitive to changes in illumination,
		rapid movement, occlusion conditions, cluttering, background appearance, and
		scale. Furthermore, the per-frame computations should take no more than $100$
		milliseconds to be useful for real-time applications. These challenging
		conditions have led to many different approaches, most probabilistic in
		nature.
		\\ \\
		To track an object, we must iteratively establish its position in subsequent
		frames based on a known initial position. The essential step is then to create
		a target representation, such as a histogram, and attempt to find the position
		that best matches this representation in the next frame(s). If the tracker
		employs a brute-force algorithm, we may only exploit temporal locality in
		this matching step; that is, we assume the object's new position will be
		``close to'' its old one and search outwards in eg. a radial pattern. Such
		a brute-force tracker does no more than comparing the histogram $h_{x,y}^{w,h}$
		centered at each pixel $(x, y)$ with search-window dimensions $(w, h)$ to
		the target object histogram $h_{O}$ specified beforehand. Although this
		approach can be parallelized, the computational complexity renders it
		generally infeasible for larger windows.
		\\ \\
		A more efficient strategy is to incorporate kernel-weighted histograms.
		Each histogram pixel is now assigned a weight by a kernel mask based on
		its distance from the center-point. Because pixels further from the
		center of the tracked object will be the first to become occluded or
		warped under transformation, their values are less reliable. A kernel
		also imposes a ``smooth'' distance metric over histograms, which is
		required for the mean-shift step discussed below. The target's center
		pixel acts as the reference point; thus, the window width and height
		need to be odd. The efficiency gain comes from the fact that we can
		now steer the tracker towards the object's most likely new position
		by following the gradient rather than by examining all pixels within
		the local environment. This new position is derived from the histogram
		whose Bhattacharyya distance to the target's histogram representation
		is smallest.
		\\ \\
		In the tracking phase we calculate the kernel-based histogram for the target during
		each frame $f$. Then for each new frame we calculate the \textit{candidate} histogram
		centered at the target's last known position. A combination of equations $10$ and $13$
		from \cite{KBOT} over a window of size $(w, h)$ then produces the new location estimate
		$(x_{f+1}, y_{f+1})$. This gives us the \textit{mean-shift} from which the tracker's name
		is derived. However, a limitation of the algorithm is that this shift can sometimes exceed
		the target, taking many extra iterations to be re-aligned. A practical hack to avoid this
		problem as mentioned in \cite{KBOT} is to check whether the histogram at the position halfway
		between the object's old position and the new estimate is a better match in terms of the
		Bhattacharyya distance.
		\\ \\
		The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section $2$ outlines the mathematical
		foundations of the mean-shift tracker in detail. Section $3$ relates this theory to our
		\verb|MATLAB| implementation and issues we encountered. We evaluate our tracker and present
		results in section $4$, and conclude in section $5$. Finally, section $6$ offers some directions
		for future work.

	\section{Theoretical Background}
		Two components can be distinguished in a tracker; the \textit{Object Model}
		and the \textit{Tracking Model}. The first is concerned with localizing and
		representing the type of object to be tracked up from the individual pixels,
		while the second deals with the high-level task of filtering to describe object
		motion.
		In abstract terms, this process of filtering can be modelled as a discrete-time
		dynamical system through the well known state-space approach. Each state $x_k$
		(for $k=0, 1, ...$) characterizes the relevant information about the tracked
		object, and dynamically evolves over time according to $x_k = f_k(x_{k - 1}, v_k)$
		where $v_k$ is the $k$-th (i.i.d) noise item. The states are not directly observable;
		rather a sequence of measurements $\{z_k\}$ evolving via $z_k = h_k(x_k, n_k)$
		(with $\{n_k\}$ another i.i.d noise sequence) provides ``hints'' about the true
		state at each time-step $k$, which is a latent variable. The tracker's task
		is now to estimate $x_k$ given all preceding measurements $z_{1:k}$, ie. it
		must recover the unknown probability density function $P(x_k \mid z_{1:k})$.
		This formulation leads to the general technique of recursive Bayesian estimation,
		which assumes the states $\{x_k\}$ and observations $\{z_k\}$ to be the hidden
		and visible parts of a hidden Markov model (HMM). The RBE method constructs the
		p.d.f in a prediction and an update step conceptually similar to those of the
		Expectation-Maximization algorithm family. When $v_k$ and $n_k$ are Gaussian
		and the prediction and update functions $f_k$ and $h_k$ are (non-)linear, the
		estimator becomes an instance of the (Extended) Kalman filter. However, other
		filter classes can also be used.
		\\ \\
		The mean-shift tracker assumes only small changes in location and appearance
		of the target object between two consecutive frames. This enables an efficient
		gradient-based localization scheme. Specifically, the target object is spatially
		masked with an isotropic kernel, which allows us to define a smooth similarity
		function and reducing the localization problem to a search in this function's
		basin of attraction (ie., all points in the state-space that enter the same
		region $R$ over time). The MST's object model is given by a histogram in some
		color-space. This is a non-parametric color density estimate, extracted both
		for the target-object model (p.d.f) $q$ and for the per-frame target-object
		candidates $p(\tbf{v})$; where $\tbf{v} = (x, y)$. The similarity function
		between histograms $p$ and $q$ is abstractly denoted by $\rho[p(\tbf{v}), q]$.
		This function is regularized by applying an isotropic spatial Epanechnikov kernel
		to the objects so that large variations in spectral information for adjacent image
		pixels are suppressed and continuous spatial data is retained, allowing the use of
		gradient-based methods to search for its maxima.
		\\ \\
		The Bhattacharyya distance measures the similarity of two discrete or continuous
		probability distributions. It is related to the Bhattacharyya coefficient, which
		measures the amount of overlap between two statistical sample-sets. The coefficient
		can be used to determine the relative closeness of two given samples; in our case,
		histograms. For continuous distributions, the coefficient is defined as
		$\rho[p, q] = \int \sqrt{p(x) \cdot q(x) } \delta x$, $0 \leq \rho \leq 1$.
		Calculating the Bhattacharyya coefficient involves integration of the overlap
		of the two samples. The interval of the values of the two samples $a$ and $b$
		is split into a chosen number of discrete bins $n$, and the number of members
		$a_i$ and $b_i$ of each sample in each bin $i$ summed according to
		$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{\Sigma a_i \cdot \Sigma b_i}$. Each partition that contains
		members from both samples contributes to the coefficient, as do partitions that
		share a large degree of overlap of the members of the two samples  within it. The
		choice of $n$ depends on the number of members in $a$ and $b$; too few partitions
		will incur loss of accuracy by over-estimating the region of overlap, while too many
		will also reduce the accuracy due to under-estimation. From $\rho$, the Bhattacharyya
		\textit{distance} is $d = \sqrt{1 - \rho[p, q]}$.


	\section{Implementation}
		The core of the implementation of the tracker follows the algorithm described
		in \cite{KBOT} closely, but with some small changes.
		\\ \\
		The target model is represented by a kernel-weighted histogram. We implement the
		Epanechnikov weight-function by pre-calculating a 2D table of kernel values equal
		in size to the target region which stores the weight for each relative pixel
		position. We add the weight per pixel to the corresponding histogram bin via a single
		lookup into this table. The target region is scaled to unit height and width as well
		as any future candidate region, therefore the kernel needs to be calculated only once
		beforehand.
		\\ \\
		The weights needed to calculate the eventual shift are given by equation ($10$)
		from \cite{KBOT} and can be calculated at once using a back-projection approach.
		By calculating $H=\sqrt{\frac{M}{H_0}}$, where $M$ is the target model and $H_0$
		is the candidate histogram, the weights are stored in a histogram. Now it is
		possible to use back-projection on this new histogram $H$ and the image patch
		$P_0$ to set the corresponding weight for every pixel in the image patch by
		using the histogram $H$ as a lookup table.
		\\ \\
		With the weights calculated, the shift from the current position to a new position
		is derived by summing over the products of the positions relative from the center
		of the image patch and their corresponding weights (line 18 in algorithm \ref{alg:MST}).
		This shift however can be too large, and the new position can pass the real position
		of the object. A method to deal with large shifts is to iteratively reduce the distance
		between the old position and the new position by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ until the
		condition $\rho_{H_1} < \rho_{H_0}$ is met, where $\rho_{H_x}$ is the Bhattacharyya
		distance between the target candidate histogram $H_x$ and the target model $M$.
		\\ \\
		The final step in the implementation is the acceptation or rejection of the new
		position with respect to the old position. In our implementation we set the condition
		to the norm of the new minus the old position to be zero in order to accept the new
		position. If this is not the case, the new position is used in a recursive call to
		the \verb|MeanShiftRecursive| function. The depth of recursion is constrained to a
		maximum of $4$ steps to keep reasonable speed and in practice this depth gives good
		results.
		\\ \\
		Since caching all the frames of our animation test-sequences prior to
		tracking would cost a prohibitive amount of memory, we read each frame
		incrementally from disk on an as-needed basis. However, this reduces
		performance. Ideally, for any given frame number, we would pre-load the
		next $n$ frames in a separate thread, but \verb|MATLAB| provides no such
		facilities.
		\\ \\
		A pseudo-code global overview of the tracker is included below.

			Of crucial importance to the implementation is the selection of the right
			color-space for the target-object model. The color-space is a major factor
			in determinining the tracker's discriminative ability based on whether it
			is sensitive to illumination changes (eg. color and direction), specular
			highlights, radiant intensity, object geometry and surface orientation,
			and other properties. Very often the ``best''\footnote{In so far as this
			can be objectively established.} color-space is also dependent on the
			domain of interest. For example, when tracking brightly-colored soccer
			players moving across the field (a large diffuse grass surface), the
			normalized-RGB system will be better capable of discriminating fore-
			and background pixels than the RGB system from which it originates.
			Figure \ref{fig:CORAL} illustrates this as well.
			\\ \\
			We evaluate our tracker in the \verb|RGB|, \verb|rgb|, \verb|HSV|, and
			\verb|OCS| spaces. The object model is then a $2D$ (\verb|rgb|) or $3D$
			(\verb|RGB|, \verb|HSV|, \verb|OCS|) histogram respectively. The number
			of bins per histogram is not a function of the number of dimensions, ie.
			each dimension contains $N^{\frac{1}{d}}$ bins ($d \in \{2, 3\}$) of width
			$16$ where $N$ is the total bin-count. For a detailed overview of the various
			color-spaces, we refer to \cite{COLOR}.

		%% Histogram distances
		%% To check the result you get from the object detection and to maybe choose
		%% between several detected objects, you can compare the histograms of the
		%% target and the candidate objects. So you create a histogram for the candidate
		%% objects in exactly the same fashion as you did for the target. Now you need
		%% to compare the candidate and target histogram, in some meaningful way. The

		%% \\ \\
		%% Euclidean distance: The Euclidean distance between histograms calculates the
		%% following distance between all histogram bins: $(b1 - b2)^2$, then sums this
		%% over all bins and takes the square root.
		%% \\ \\
		%% Bhattacharyya distance: The Bhattacharyya distance is a measure to compare

		%% Bhattacharyya distance is calculated as follows. First the Bhattacharyya
		%% coefficient is determined by $\rho[p, q] = \int \sqrt{p(u) \cdot q(u) } \delta u$,
		%% then the Bhattacharyya distance is determined from this by $d = \sqrt{1 - \rho[p, q]}$.

	\section{Evaluation and Results}
		%% Once you think you completed the mean-shift tracker, it is time to test your
		%% implementations on videos from different domains and analyze the performance
		%% of different color spaces. What are the advantages and disadvantages of certain
		%% color spaces, when do you think you should use one color space instead of the
		%% other, etc. After that, you can think about improvements of the tracker. This
		%% involves a thorough analysis of your current version, including an analysis of
		%% the strong and weak points. If you know when your tracker goes wrong, you can
		%% think of possible solutions to overcome these difficulties.
		%% \\ \\
		%% Note that the most important part is to implement the tracker in a correct way.
		%% After you made sure your implementation is correct, try the tracker on a video
		%% in a different domain (search on the internet to find a good video or create your
		%% own video). Keep in mind that when looking for a suitable video, the goal is not
		%% to show how good the tracker works, but try to put your finger on the strong and
		%% weak parts of the algorithm. After you analyzed these strong and weak points of
		%% the algorithm, try to come up with suggestions to improve your design. If there
		%% is still enough time, you can implement one or more of your suggestions and analyze
		%% the results (for instance, how does your improvement compare to the original algorithm
		%% with respect to the weak as well as the strong parts of the original algorithm). If
		%% you run out of time, you can describe how you would change the design and explain your
		%% expectations of this change.
		Evaluation of the tracker is not a trivial task even if we are provided with a ground-truth
		to use for measuring the performance of the tracker. Since we are interested in the various
		pros and cons of the tracker we conducted experiments on several domains. For our experiments
		we chose three different domains: sport, urban and nature. For each of these domains we use
		two different environments within the domain and conduct a tracking experiment for each color
		space described earlier. To test the robustness on these domains we do need some constraints
		within the videos themselves. The most important constraint is that the target is not fully
		occluded during tracking, since the tracker cannot handle this properly in our implementation.
		Another important constraint to the videos is that there should not be any cuts to different
		cameras in the movie when tracking the object. Since mean-shift tracks the object from frame
		to frame, it cannot handle tracking objects that appear in totally different locations due
		to such cuts. A final constraint is that the object should not scale too much. The tracker
		can deal with some scaling but the tracker patch does not grow or shrink when the object gets
		scaled. The evaluation criterion is simple: for each video and for each color-space, we test
		whether it is possible to track a certain object for the entire sequence of frames.

		The sporting domain gives us a more controlled environment for tracking. Formula-One is set on
		grey roads with green grass surrounding it, making it possible to track racecars with certain
		color schemes fairly easy. Tracking in the soccer domain also benefits from the environment of
		the players and their clothing. However, the controlled environment can also be of negative
		influence. For example, when tracking a Formula-One car we observe that using only the hue gives
		the best tracking results in general. But problems are encountered when using hue if the target
		model consists of white-like colors. Because of complications in illumination or video compression,
		these white-like colors can contain colors from their surroundings therefore giving them hue-values
		closer to the surrounding colors. This can result in objects completely dissapearing in the hue channel
		as shown in figure \ref{fig:HUE}. The usage of all three components from HSV can solve some of these
		issues as more information is preserved.

		\noindent
		The urban domain gives a more challenging environment since we can expect about anything in the
		scenery. Illumination, shadow, clutter and about any color is present, as well as spatial issues
		like occlusion and changing appearances. For this domain we chose walking people and free-running
		people (an urban sport). Because of the huge variety in features the tracking results are much more
		dependent on the color-spaces. In table \ref{table:ped} results on the urban environment are listed.
		We observe that for every sequence of frames, the tracking could only succeed for a single (or at
		most two) color-space(s). The usage of full color-spaces instead of only one component for hue or
		two components for normalized rgb is to be expected since they preserve more information on the
		target model. A particularly challenging problem was found in the experiment of the Pedestrian-Walk
		(1) sequence. The person walks in front of glass windows with high reflectance and a pile of stones
		of all kinds of colors. This resulted in the tracker getting lost most of the time for all color
		spaces because the window and the pile of stones contain all colors of the target model. The only
		way to solve this in our implementation is to be very precise when selecting a target model. Another
		interesting observation and a perfect example for the importance of color-space selection was made
		on the Pedestrian-FreeRun (1) sequence. Here, $3$ out of $5$ color-spaces failed immediatly, and the
		hue-only model had issues keeping track of the movement of the freerunner. The OCS color-system
		however worked perfectly because of the clothing of the person (see figure \ref{fig:FREE}).

		Our final domain of nature is also a domain with a huge variety of features similar to

		sequence failed for all color-spaces because of the coral being camouflage for the type
		of fish, and the other fish sequences performed very well because of the distinctive color
		the fish has. The running cheetah was also camouflaged by its environment. But with the
		target model consisting of few features of the cheetah (black spots and some white fur),
		without the interference of shadows or lightspots it could be tracked using the HSV color
		space. See figure \ref{fig:RESULTS} for final results of the tracker.

	\section{Conclusion}
		We have built and tested a mean-shift tracking system inspired by the work of
		\cite{KBOT}. Overall, this tracker performs well regardless of the interest
		domain whenever the target-object is distinctive with respect to its local
		environment and if this is the case, it can also handle occlusion very well. 
		However, in other situtations, the limitations of a tracker of this nature
		become apparent: following a blob of pixels without high-level reasoning
		about the semantics of these pixels cannot be made sufficiently robust
		against general object transformation. This problem is exacerbated further if
		the chosen color-system reduces the distinction between object and background
		pixels. It might be advantageous to determine the optical flow between frames
		via eg. Lucas-Kanade and integrate this information into the tracker so as to
		decouple the mean-shift estimate from the color-system.
